What is my software design process?

I design software by breaking large problems into small pieces. For this assignment, I used a modular style that divided responsibility between classes (SceneManager, ShaderManager, ShapeMeshes). This made the system simpler to maintain, reuse, and extend. I also considered user input early in the design so that the camera and controls were simple to use.

What are some new design abilities that your project work has enabled you to develop?

My project work enabled me to develop robust design abilities in designing in 3D worlds, including working with transformations, lighting, and texture mapping. I further learned to work with managing graphics pipelines and separating the rendering logic from the scene management.

What design process did you employ in your project work?

I employed an iterative design process:

Started with a basic rendering pipeline and background.

Added individual shapes and tested their transitions.

Added camera controls, lighting, and textures.

Refined the scene into a cohesive 3D world.

Each step built upon the previous, allowing me to test and refine continuously.

How would methods from your design process be applied to continuing work?

Dismantling an intricate system into modules and testing each step can be used in any program. It minimizes mistakes, maximizes maintainability, and provides room for scaling in the future.

How do I develop programs?

I develop incrementally and test. Adding one feature at a time, like keyboard input or texture mapping, allowed me to test each component before continuing. This saved me time debugging and made the quality of my end product better.

What new development approaches did you employ in doing your 3D scene?

I used camera control implementation methods (WASD, QE, mouse orientation, and zoom) that were the learning experience of working with real-time user input and interaction in 3D space. I used texture mapping and lighting too, which required meticulous ordering of the OpenGL calls and careful debugging.

How did iteration contribute to your development?

Iteration was fundamental to my development. I iteratively experimented, adjusted, and developed features—be it scaling objects, modifying light sources, or tweaking camera speed. Each iteration brought the scene nearer to the target design.

How has your approach to coding evolved through the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?

Throughout the milestones, I managed to learn how to start small and gradually accumulate. In the beginning, I was practicing only outputting shapes, but eventually, I became braver in incorporating more attributes like textures and interactivity. This taught me the importance of incremental growth, modularity, and continuous testing.

How can computer science help me reach my goals?

Computer science gives me the ability to develop software solutions to real-world problems. By learning areas such as computational graphics, I enhance my ability to develop interactive software and simulations. This directly supports my career goal in software development as well as potentially graphics programming.

How do computational graphics and visualizations equip you with new competencies and knowledge that can be incorporated into your future learning process?

Computational graphics has enhanced my abilities in math, algorithms, and spatial thinking. These skills will contribute to future computer science graduate-level coursework and allow me to approach future projects with more confidence and technical acumen.

In what ways do computational graphics and visualizations give you new skills and knowledge that you can leverage on your future career path?

In a professional setup, the ability to define and control 3D space has far-reaching applications—ranging from game development to data visualisation and even UI/UX development for interactive software. These abilities improve my versatility as a programmer and prepare me for careers in which visualization and interactivity are key.
